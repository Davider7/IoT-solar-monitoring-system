# IoT-solar-monitoring-system
The implementation of this project was guided by clear goals that directly connect to the research objectives outlined in the earlier chapters. The main aim was to build an IoT-based solar panel monitoring system that could track, analyze, and report important parameters affecting the efficiency of a solar panel.
